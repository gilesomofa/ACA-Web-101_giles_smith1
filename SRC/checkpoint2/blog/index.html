  <p><h1>There Is Medicine Right Under Your Nose</h1>
Many people don't realize that as they walk down the street, even in the most urban location, wherever there are plants, there is medicine.
Many of the plants that Americans spend millions of dollars trying radicate each year are actually beneficial. Some more than others. Many of
them have qualities that can help us maintain our health and even feed us. Plants such as Amaranth and purslane have been and continue to be part
of the the diet of many people in the world. These two herbs in specific offer not only amazing nutrition, but great medicinal and spiritual
value to several cultures on different continents. Amaranth is used as a food and medicine in North America, particularly in Mexico, where it was sacred
to the Aztec people, who used it for its leaves as greens and also made flour from this amazing plant as well. In Africa and the Caribbean, Amaranth is a
common pot herb that is prepared and used in soups and stews. In Northern Europe, warriors would make amulets with Amaranth that were thought to make them
invincible on the battle field.  At Rue Atelier, we make a tincture using Amaranth sourced from a local organic farm. Amaranth grows wild along the roadside,
in alleys, as well as in abandoned lots and much to the disdain of people who are lawn conscious, in lawns all over America. Many people regard it as a nuisance
in their gardens as it is not easily killed by herbicides. It must be uprooted by literally digging it out. Wherever Amaranth is growing, all other plants will
have a hard time establishing and maintaining themselves.

  <p><h1>Anti-depressant Bacteria In Garden Soil?</h1>
With billions of dollars being spent every year in this country on anti-depressant drugs, citizens of the US are being prescribed an unprecedented amount
of drugs to combat a very real mental health crisis in our country.  Do you know anyone that is an avid gardener? If so, have you ever noticed that this
person seems just a bit more together emotionally than most other people you know? Well, there is a reason for this. It has been recently proved in research
what gardeners have known for milenia. There is a bacteria in soil that is a natural anti-depressant. Dr. Christopher Lowry, associate professor in the
department of integrative physiology at University of Colorado at Boulder led a study of Mycobacterium Vaccae. In this study, mice were injected with this
bacteria which reduced greatly stress response. This may be, because the presence of the bacteria increases serotonin in the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal
cortex modulates anxiety. The bacteria was discovered in Lake Kyoga in Uganda during the 1970s by an immunologist named John Stanford. Dr.Stanford recognized
that the residents of who lived in the area responded better to certain leprosy vaccines that were being administered there. They realized that the bacterium found
in the soil by the lakeshore had "immune-modulating properties" that enhanced the efficacy of the vaccines.l So, consider getting out into the garden when you
are feeling a little or a lot stressed. Not only will you be growing organic food or pollinators, you will also be boosting your immune system and experiencing positive
mental health boost from the magical bacteria in the soil. Stay dirty my friends.
