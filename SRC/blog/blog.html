            <h3>Blog Post 1 highlights: Git, Workflow, ARIA</h3>I'm so excited to make my first blog entry. GIT is a version control system, whose purpose is to manage projects as they evolve. This system is employed by individuals or teams as they update web pages or other projects. The beauty of Git is that many people can work on the same project all the while keeping all versions of the work as they go along. Also, team members can work remotely and in different parts of the world and share their work, revise, comment, and share ideas as the project moves forward. Many discussions can be found comparing Git and Subversion. It seems that many prefer to use Git because of its ability to support easier decentralization and access to repositories, which as I mentioned above, is useful when several people are working in remote places on a project. It seems that Subversion may be more forgving in its file creation and management capabilities.  From what I have read, Git is written in C, Shell, Perl, Tcl, and Python.  Today in class, I learned how to create a git repository from the terminal.  My workflow when creating a webpage honestly is a bit haphazard.  I don't have much experience coding. Now I know to create a plan, or outline describing what I want to accomplish and draw it out on paper before getting started. ARIA means Accessible Rich Internet Applications. They are used to make the internet more accessible to users who may not be able to use a mouse or pointing device, or who may be in some shape or form unable to read the content on a web page.  WAI-ARIA describes how to add semantics and other metadata to HTML content in order to make user interface controls and dynamic content more accessible.

            <h3>Blog Post 2 hightlights: BFC, inline, inline-block, browser sepcific issues</h3>There are a few ways to visually hide content from web pages(making the content visable only to screen readers). You can use the hidden tag in CSS, positioning the content absolutely and moving it off of the page. Another way is to use the clip property in a container. You can specify the dimensions of an absolutely positioned element using top, right, bottom, and left values, creating a boxed container for the content. By setting all values to 0 pixels, the content becomes invisible. BFC is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It’s the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements. This context is created when one of many elements are employed. Here are a few but not an exhaustive list of examples: when floats are employed, table captions, instances where absolute or fixed positioning is used, or block elements where overflow has a value other than visible. BFC provides a way for a parent to contain children who have specific properties that would otherwise create layout challenges if they weren’t in a BFC.  

            Today in class I learned the importance of creating websites that are responsive.  As far as the experience of the user goes, having a responsive website creates a more enjoyable experience where the style and elegance of a design is maintained no matter what screen size is being employed.  It’s just best practice to make all webpages responsive. 
            
            The difference between inline and inline-block is that elements displayed inline block allow you to set width and height on an element. Also, top and bottom margins and padding are respected in inline-block. They are not in inline.
            
            I would approach browser-specific styling issues mainly using media queries. @AustiCodingAcademy

            <h3>Blog Post 3 highligts, Responsive Vs Mobile-First, Flexbox and Grid, Positioning, @Media Queries, Pseudo-Elements, and Writing effective CSS gotchas</h3> The difference to coding a website to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy has several factors involved.  Statistics have shown that more than half of websites are accessed via mobile technology.  Depending on the target audience for particular websites, this number can increase drastically.  An example would be a restaurant website in a crowded metropolitan area.  Using the 80%-20% rule is a good way to determine whether to use Mobile first or responsive.  This rule states that if 80% of your target audience is on desktops, you should build a responsive site. If 80% of audience is on mobile, you should use a mobile first approach. If your target audience is split evenly between these two mediums, perhaps the best approach would be to build two websites-one for mobile first and another for responsive approach. The advantages of a responsive website are: 
            “Good for heavily stacked information websites
            Easier for large forms and complex call-to-actions
            Cost-effective development and maintenance
            Great for SEO
            
            Whereas,
            “The advantages of a mobile first site are:  Better user-experience on mobile devices
            Majority of internet browsing is on a smartphone
             Design website to use built-in phone features
            Cheaper than building an iOS, Android or Hybrid App”
            
            One @media property other than “screen” is “print”. This allows us to use a #header-image{ display: none} in order to save time and resources when someone chooses to print our page.
            
            CSS has a property called the “position” property, where elements on a webpage may be assigned difference placement. These are “static”, “fixed”, “absolute”, “relative”, and “sticky”. A “static” position is the default of HTML, where the top, bottom, left or right properties do not affect it’s positioning. A “fixed” position forces an element to remain in the same position even if the page is being scrolled. An “absolutely” position element is positioned relative to its nearest ancestor and not in relation to the viewport. A “relatively” positioned element will be adjusted relative to its original position. A “sticky” positioned element will toggle between fixed and relative. This means that it will remain in a certain position until some parameter has changed to some determined value, which causes it to stick in a certain position.
            Pseudo-Elements are used to style particular parts of an element like the first line of a sentence or the first line of a paragraph or to insert content before or after the content of an element.
            
            CSS Flexbox and Grids are both powerful additions to CSS and allow a developer to layout a webpage using, in the case of Flexbox, containers and manipulating items in a one-dimensional axis, and in the case of Grids, two-dimensional rows and columns. Both Flexbox and Grids have allowed developers of placing elements in webpages in a more efficient straight -orward way since their inception.  They can be used in conjunction and both have their unique strengths that make them more appropriate in different situations.
            
            While writing CSS it is very important to maintain certain practices one should always take into consideration.  Some of   these best practices are as follows:
            -Name things intelligently
            -Don’t overuse “!Important”-this may override and negatively affect other important code. This is particular important to observe as it may confound other developers who work on your code after you have.
            -Being consistent
            -Use dry code; don’t repeating yourself @AustiCodingAcademy
